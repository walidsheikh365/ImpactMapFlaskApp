Due to the following error, browser tests haven't been able to run with Github Actions.

'AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'Flask.__init__.<locals>.<lambda>'

As such, the test was performed manually with the flask app running.
See video of the tests in README_assets/Testing_Proof or directly
from the README file.

Below is the code used alternatively with Github Actions.


@pytest.fixture(scope='class')
def run_app(app):
    """
    Fixture to run the Flask app for Selenium browser tests
    """
    multiprocessing.set_start_method("spawn", force=True)  # Needed in Python 3.8 and later
    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=app.run, args=())
    process.start()
    yield process
    process.terminate()
